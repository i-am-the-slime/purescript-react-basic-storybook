import Checkbox from "./Checkbox.tsx"

# Installation

‚ö†Ô∏è The initial setup involves quite a few steps but if you're strong for 5 minutes, you'll be rewarded.

I added some checkboxes (<Checkbox />) so you can keep track of how far you got (<Checkbox checked />).

### JavaScript setup

<Checkbox /> Install the NPM packages:

```sh
npm install -D \
  storybook@next \
  @storybook/addon-essentials@next \
  @storybook/addon-interactions@next \
  @storybook/react-webpack5@next \
  @storybook/testing-library
```

<Checkbox /> Add two JavaScript scripts in `package.json`:
```json
  "scripts": {
    //...,
    "storybook": "storybook dev -p 6006",
    "build-storybook": "storybook build"
    }
```

<Checkbox /> Create a `.storybook` folder in the top level directory.

Then
  - <Checkbox /> Copy [`.storybook/main.ts`](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-react-basic-storybook/tree/main/example/.storybook/main.ts) (üëàüèæ this is a link)
  - <Checkbox /> And [`.storybook/purescript-indexer.ts`](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-react-basic-storybook/tree/main/example/.storybook/purescript-indexer.ts) (üëàüèæ this is a link, too)

to your `.storybook/` folder.

### This concludes the JavaScript setup üéâ

Now the PureScript setup

## Setup PureScript project

<Checkbox /> Create the folder `/stories/Story` where all your stories will live

<Checkbox /> Create a `stories.dhall` file in your project root with this content:

```dhall
let conf = ./spago.dhall

in    conf
    ‚´Ω { sources = conf.sources # [ "stories/**/*.purs" ]
      , dependencies =
            conf.dependencies
          # [ "react-basic-storybook"
            , "web-html"
            , "aff"
            , "aff-promise"
            , "record"
            , "unsafe-coerce"
            , "web-dom"
            , "debug"
            ]
      }
```

Now you can build your stories with `spago -x stories.dhall build`.

But you don't actually have any stories yet!


Now you can play around with the [general workflow](./?path=/docs/introduction-workflow--docs).
