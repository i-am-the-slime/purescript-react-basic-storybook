Run this in a terminal on the side:

```sh
npm run storybook
```

This will open your Browser on `http://localhost:6006` and you can live edit
your stories and components in your favourite text editor.

## Your first story
Create the following file under `/stories/Story/HelloStorybook`

```purescript
module Story.HelloStorybook (default, helloStorybook, helloPureScript) where

import Prelude

import React.Basic.DOM as R
import React.Basic.Hooks as React
import Storybook (Meta, Story, meta, simpleStory)

default :: Meta
default = meta { component: mkHello }

helloStorybook ∷ Story
helloStorybook = simpleStory "Storybook"

helloPureScript ∷ Story
helloPureScript = simpleStory "PureScript"

-- The component that this "Story" is about
-- This would usually be a component from your main project
mkHello :: React.Component String
mkHello = React.component "HelloSayer" \to ->
  pure $ R.text ("Hello " <> to <> "!")
```
